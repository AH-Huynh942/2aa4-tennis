## Problem Description

This problem is a classical Coding Dojo: [Tennis Coding Dojo](https://codingdojo.
org/kata/Tennis/). The objective is to implement a soring system for a simplified version of tennis.

The scoring system is rather simple:

1. Each player can have either of these points in one game: `love`, `15`, `30`, `40`.
2. If you have `40` and you win the point you win the game, however there are special rules.
3. If both have `40` the players are _deuce_.
4. If the game is in _deuce_, the winner of a point will have _advantage_
5. If the player with _advantage_ wins the ball he wins the game
6. If the player without _advantage_ wins they are back at deuce.
